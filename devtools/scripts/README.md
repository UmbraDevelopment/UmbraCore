# Utility Scripts

This directory contains simple utility scripts that don't fit into other specific categories. These scripts are typically shorter, self-contained utilities that perform specific tasks.

## Purpose

These scripts provide various utility functions, including:

- Simple one-off tasks
- Quick fixes for common issues
- Helper scripts for development workflows
- Miscellaneous automation tasks

## Usage Guidelines

When adding new scripts to this directory:

1. Ensure the script has a clear, focused purpose
2. Add appropriate documentation within the script
3. Use a descriptive filename that indicates the script's function
4. Consider whether the script might better belong in one of the more specialised directories

If a script grows in complexity or becomes part of a larger system, consider moving it to a more appropriate directory in the devtools structure.
