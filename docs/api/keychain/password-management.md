# Password Management

The password management system in UmbraKeychainService provides comprehensive functionality for handling secure credentials.

## Password Requirements

```swift
struct PasswordRequirements {
    let minLength: Int
    let requiresUppercase: Bool
    let requiresLowercase: Bool
    let requiresNumbers: Bool
    let requiresSpecialChars: Bool
    let maxConsecutiveChars: Int
    let bannedPasswords: Set<String>
}
```

### Default Requirements

- Minimum length: 12 characters
- Must include uppercase and lowercase letters
- Must include at least one number
- Must include at least one special character
- No more than 3 consecutive identical characters
- Cannot be in the banned passwords list

## Password Validation

The `PasswordValidator` protocol defines the interface for password validation:

```swift
protocol PasswordValidator {
    func validateStrength(_ password: String) -> PasswordStrength
    func validateRequirements(_ password: String) -> [PasswordRequirement]
}
```

### Strength Levels

- **Weak**: Fails to meet minimum requirements
- **Moderate**: Meets minimum requirements
- **Strong**: Exceeds minimum requirements
- **Very Strong**: Significantly exceeds requirements

## Password Rotation

Passwords can be configured with expiration policies:

```swift
struct PasswordMetadata {
    let creationDate: Date
    let expirationDate: Date?
    let lastRotated: Date?
    let strengthScore: Int
}
```

### Rotation Policies

- **Time-based**: Rotate after a specified duration
- **Access-based**: Rotate after number of uses
- **Strength-based**: Rotate when strength requirements change

## Error Handling

Common password-related errors:

- `WeakPasswordError`: Password doesn't meet requirements
- `ExpiredPasswordError`: Password needs rotation
- `ValidationError`: General validation failures
- `RotationError`: Issues during password rotation

## Best Practices

1. Always use the validation system
2. Implement automatic rotation
3. Handle errors appropriately
4. Use secure password generation
5. Maintain audit logs

## Examples

### Validating a Password

```swift
let validator = DefaultPasswordValidator()
let strength = validator.validateStrength("MySecurePass123!")
let requirements = validator.validateRequirements("MySecurePass123!")
```

### Rotating a Password

```swift
let rotator = PasswordRotator()
try await rotator.rotatePassword(
    identifier: "main-backup-repo",
    newPassword: generateSecurePassword()
)
```
