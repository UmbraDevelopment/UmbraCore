# UmbraKeychainService Overview

The UmbraKeychainService module provides secure credential management and storage capabilities for UmbraCore. It handles all sensitive data operations through a secure XPC service.

## Features

- Secure password management with validation
- Keychain integration for credential storage
- Biometric authentication support
- XPC service for isolated credential handling
- Automatic password rotation and expiry
- Secure backup and restore capabilities

## Architecture

The service is built on three main components:

1. **XPC Service**: Isolated process for handling sensitive operations
2. **Keychain Integration**: Direct interface with the system keychain
3. **Client Library**: Swift API for application integration

## Getting Started

See the following guides for detailed information:

- [Password Management](password-management.md)
- [Secure Storage](secure-storage.md)
- [XPC Integration](xpc-integration.md)

## Security Considerations

The service follows strict security practices:

- All operations run in an isolated XPC service
- Credentials never leave the secure enclave
- Biometric authentication for sensitive operations
- Automatic credential rotation
- Secure error handling to prevent information leaks
