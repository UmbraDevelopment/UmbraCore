# UmbraCore Cryptographic Strategy

## Overview

UmbraCore implements a sophisticated dual-library cryptographic strategy to support both native macOS security features and cross-process operations. This document outlines the technical details of this implementation.

## Architecture

### Dual-Library Implementation

#### 1. CryptoKit (Apple's Framework)
- **Primary Use**: ResticBar and native macOS operations
- **Key Features**:
  - Hardware-backed security through Secure Enclave
  - Native integration with macOS security features
  - Optimised for sandboxed environments
  - Secure key storage with Keychain integration

#### 2. CryptoSwift (Third-party Library)
- **Primary Use**: Rbum and Rbx cross-process operations
- **Key Features**:
  - Platform-independent implementation
  - XPC service compatibility
  - Flexible deployment options
  - Cross-process encryption support

### KeyManager

The KeyManager serves as the orchestration layer between these implementations:

#### Core Responsibilities
1. **Implementation Selection**
   - Context-aware routing between CryptoKit and CryptoSwift
   - Security boundary enforcement
   - Operation validation

2. **Key Lifecycle Management**
   - Key generation and storage
   - Rotation policies and execution
   - Validation and verification
   - Cross-process synchronisation

3. **Security Context Management**
   - Sandbox compliance
   - XPC service coordination
   - Permission management
   - Resource access control

#### Implementation Details

```swift
actor KeyManager {
    // Context-aware implementation selection
    func selectImplementation(for operation: CryptoOperation) -> CryptoImplementation
    
    // Key lifecycle operations
    func generateKey(for context: SecurityContext) async throws -> Key
    func rotateKey(id: KeyIdentifier) async throws
    func validateKey(id: KeyIdentifier) async throws -> ValidationResult
    
    // Cross-process coordination
    func synchroniseKeys() async throws
    func validateSecurityBoundaries() async throws
}
```
