# SwiftFormat Configuration Update (5 March 2025)

## Summary of Changes

We've completed a comprehensive update to UmbraCore's SwiftFormat configuration and tooling to standardize code formatting across the project. This update includes:

1. **Updated Configuration File** - `.swiftformat` now works with SwiftFormat 0.55.5 using the current syntax and rule names.

2. **Formatting Scripts** - Created `scripts/format_code.sh` for easy code formatting with options for checking, formatting specific files, and working with staged files.

3. **Git Pre-commit Hook** - Added `scripts/install-git-hooks.sh` to install a pre-commit hook that checks formatting of staged Swift files.

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Added SwiftFormat section to `swift_style_guide.md`
   - Created `IDE_INTEGRATION.md` for IDE-specific setup instructions
   - Updated `UmbraCore_Refactoring_Plan.md` to reflect completion of this task

## Key Formatting Rules

The updated SwiftFormat configuration enforces these key style elements:

- 2-space indentation
- 100 character line length
- Same-line opening braces
- Consistent spacing around operators and parentheses
- Alphabetized imports
- Standardized modifier ordering
- Hoisted pattern let bindings
- No trailing whitespace

## Usage Instructions

### Command Line Formatting

```bash
# Format all files
./scripts/format_code.sh

# Check formatting without making changes
./scripts/format_code.sh --check

# Format only staged files
./scripts/format_code.sh --staged-only

# Format specific files or directories
./scripts/format_code.sh path/to/file.swift path/to/directory
```

### Git Hook Installation

```bash
# Install git hooks
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

### IDE Integration

See `docs/IDE_INTEGRATION.md` for detailed instructions on integrating with:
- Xcode
- Visual Studio Code
- JetBrains AppCode/CLion

## Next Steps

To fully adopt the updated formatting standards across the project:

1. Install the Git hooks on your local development environment
2. Configure your IDE to use SwiftFormat with our rules
3. Consider adding SwiftFormat checks to the CI pipeline
4. Run the formatter on all files before merging significant changes

## Compatibility Notes

- The configuration is compatible with SwiftFormat 0.55.5
- Ensure your local installation is up to date using `brew upgrade swiftformat`
- All formatting rules align with the Google Swift Style Guide
- Some older rules have been updated to their newer equivalents

If you encounter any issues with the formatting configuration, please report them to the team.
