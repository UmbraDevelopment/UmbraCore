# SwiftLint Analysis Report
Generated: 24 February 2025

## Overview
This document tracks SwiftLint violations in the UmbraCore project. Each section lists violations by category and file, making it easier to track progress as we address them.

## Violation Categories

### 1. Vertical Parameter Alignment
Files with parameter alignment issues:
- [ ] `Sources/UmbraKeychainService/KeychainXPCImplementation.swift`
  - Multiple instances of misaligned parameters in function declarations

### 2. Identifier Naming
Files with naming issues:
- [ ] `Tests/CryptoTests/CryptoServiceTests.swift`
  - Variable 'iv' too short
- [ ] `Tests/CryptoTypesTests/DefaultCryptoServiceTests.swift`
  - Variable 'iv' too short

### 3. String to Data Conversion
Files with non-optimal conversions:
- [ ] `Tests/CryptoTests/CryptoServiceTests.swift`
- [ ] `Tests/CryptoTypesTests/DefaultCryptoServiceTests.swift`
- [ ] `Tests/SecurityTypesTests/MockSecurityProviderTests.swift`

### 4. Line Length
Files exceeding line length limits:
- [ ] `Tests/CryptoTests/CryptoServiceTests.swift`
  - Line 35: 124 characters (limit: 120)

### 5. Attributes
Files with attribute placement issues:
- [ ] `Sources/Core/Services/CoreService.swift`
  - Attributes should be on their own lines in functions and types

## Progress Tracking

### Statistics
- Total Files Analyzed: 178
- Total Violations: 264
- Serious Violations: 1

### Completion Status
- [ ] Vertical Parameter Alignment Issues
- [ ] Identifier Naming Issues
- [ ] String to Data Conversion Issues
- [ ] Line Length Issues
- [ ] Attribute Placement Issues

## Next Steps
1. Address vertical parameter alignment in KeychainXPCImplementation.swift
2. Fix short variable names in test files
3. Update String to Data conversions to use non-optional initializer
4. Fix line length violations
5. Correct attribute placements

## Notes
- All fixes should maintain existing functionality
- Test coverage should be maintained or improved
- Document any architectural decisions made during refactoring
