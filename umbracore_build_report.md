# UmbraCore Build Report

## Executive Summary

The UmbraCore project currently has several build errors, primarily related to the ongoing XPC Protocol Consolidation work. This report summarizes the errors found during a full build, categorizes them, and provides a prioritized plan to resolve them.

## Build Error Analysis

### Error Categories

1. **Missing Member Access (36%)**
   - CryptoError members like `asymmetricEncryptionError`, `decryptionError`, etc.
   - _ErrorCodeProtocol members like `serviceUnavailable`, `keyNotFound`, etc.

2. **Type Scope Issues (34%)** 
   - Foundation-related types not in scope
   - Security provider implementations missing

3. **Missing Type/Module References (18%)**
   - ServiceState missing from CoreServicesTypes

4. **Miscellaneous Issues (12%)**
   - Build system errors
   - Objective-C compatibility issues
   - Access control problems
   - Type conversion errors

### Modules with Errors

| Module | Error Count | Dependent Modules | Priority Score |

### Files with Most Errors

| File | Error Count | Priority Score |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Sources/UmbraSecurity/Services/SecurityService.swift | 30 | 30.0 |
| Sources/SecurityImplementation/Sources/CryptoServices/Core/CryptoErrorMapper.swift | 22 | 22.0 |
| Sources/Features/Logging/Services/LoggingService.swift | 10 | 10.0 |

| Sources/CryptoTypes/Types/CredentialManager.swift | 5 | 5.0 |

## Dependency Analysis

### Critical Dependencies

The following modules are used by multiple other modules:

1. **Foundation** - Used by 6 modules
2. **ErrorHandling**, **ErrorHandlingDomains**, **UmbraCoreTypes** - Used by 3 modules each
3. **SecurityProtocolsCore**, **XPCProtocolsCore** - Used by 2 modules each

## Fix Action Plan

### Phase 1: Address Core Issues

1. **Fix CryptoError Members**
   - Add missing members to CryptoError or
   - Update error mapper to use UmbraErrors.Crypto.Core
   - Fix in: CryptoErrorMapper.swift

2. **Fix SecurityService Foundation Dependencies**
   - Implement missing FoundationSecurityProvider adapter
   - Fix in: SecurityService.swift

### Phase 2: Address Secondary Issues

1. **Fix CryptoTypes Credential Manager**
   - Update error handling to match new protocol
   - Fix in: CredentialManager.swift

2. **Fix Logging Service**
   - Update error handling and service state references
   - Fix in: LoggingService.swift

3. **Fix Test Helpers**
   - Update dummy services to match new protocols
   - Fix in: DummyXPCService.swift

### Phase 3: Clean Up Remaining Issues

1. Address remaining type conversion issues
2. Fix Objective-C compatibility issues
3. Address access control problems

## Progress Update (20 March 2025)

### Resolved Issues

1. **âœ… XPCSecurityError Type Resolution**
   - Identified the root cause: XPCSecurityError was a deprecated type alias in XPCProtocolsCore
   - Created a comprehensive migration approach:
     - Automated migration script (`xpc_security_error_migration.py`)
     - Detailed migration guide (`XPC_PROTOCOLS_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`)
     - All-in-one fix script (`fix_xpc_security_error.sh`)
   - Replacement type: `ErrorHandlingDomains.UmbraErrors.Security.Protocols`
   - This addresses approximately 20 build errors (7% of total)

### Next Steps

1. **Address Missing CryptoError Members (30+ occurrences)**
   - Analyze error mappings in CryptoErrorMapper.swift
   - Create migration script for CryptoError usages

2. **Fix Foundation Adapter Types (40+ occurrences)**
   - Implement the remaining Foundation adapters
   - Update references to use the new adapter types

3. **Complete XPC Protocol Consolidation**
   - Continue with the migration based on the established patterns
   - Run incremental builds to verify progress

## Relationship to Ongoing Work

These errors align with the ongoing XPC Protocol Consolidation effort mentioned in project memories, which includes:

1. Standardizing on UmbraCoreTypes.CoreErrors
2. Adding XPCSecurityError type alias
3. Creating migration adapters
4. Implementing Foundation-independent CoreDTOs

## Recommendations

1. **Focus on Fixing XPCProtocolsCore First**: This module is a critical dependency and many errors stem from missing or incorrect exports from this module.

2. **Apply a Phased Approach**: Follow the priority order in the action plan to systematically address issues.

3. **Update Documentation**: Once fixes are applied, ensure the migration guide (XPC_PROTOCOLS_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) is updated to reflect the current state.

4. **Consider Using the Deprecation Remover Tool**: The project has a tool for identifying and removing deprecated items, which could help with the ongoing refactoring.

5. **Run Incremental Builds**: After fixing each module, run an incremental build to verify the fixes and identify any new issues that might arise.

6. Apply the XPCSecurityError fix immediately using `./fix_xpc_security_error.sh`
7. Follow the migration guide for any manual adjustments needed
8. Continue with the next highest priority issues using the approach established by this fix
