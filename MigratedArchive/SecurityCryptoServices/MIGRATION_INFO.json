  "changes_made": [
    "Enhanced documentation with comprehensive security context and considerations",
    "Added proper British spellings throughout documentation",
    "Improved HashingService with constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks",
    "Added verification methods for hash integrity checking",
    "Added enhanced security explanations for all cryptographic operations",
    "Implemented secure hex string conversion utilities",
    "Complete refactoring to pure actor-based architecture for Swift 6 concurrency",
    "Replaced class-based implementations with isolated actors",
    "Properly implemented async/await patterns throughout",
    "Added batch operations using Swift task groups",
    "Improved memory safety with SecureBytes handling",
    "Enhanced provider selection with environment-specific optimisations",
    "Implemented comprehensive error handling with SecurityProtocolError"

  "notes": "Successfully migrated to fully Swift 6 compliant actor-based architecture with no legacy bridges or adapters. Implementation follows British spelling conventions in documentation and provides a clean, thread-safe API for all cryptographic operations. All components now properly isolate mutable state within actors and use async/await for concurrent operations."
