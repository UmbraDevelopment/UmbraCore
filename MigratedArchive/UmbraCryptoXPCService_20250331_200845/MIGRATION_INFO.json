  "architecturalChanges": [
    "Replaced class-based implementation with actor-based concurrency",
    "Eliminated Foundation dependencies with proper DTOs",
    "Updated error handling to use domain-specific errors",
    "Implemented proper privacy-aware logging",
    "Migrated to modern Swift concurrency patterns"
  ],
  "notes": "The CryptoXPCServiceActor provides a thread-safe implementation of cryptographic operations via XPC using Foundation-independent DTOs and domain-specific errors. It follows the Alpha Dot Five architecture with proper actor isolation for all mutable state."
