/**
 # XPC Service Status
 
 This file defines the structure for reporting XPC service status information
 in a standardized format across all UmbraCore XPC services.
 
 ## Features
 
 * Timestamp information for when status was captured
 * Protocol and service version information
 * Optional device identification
 * Support for additional service-specific status information
 * Full Codable support for serialization
