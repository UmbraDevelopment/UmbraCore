/// (source, operation, details).
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// do {
///     try processPayment(amount: 100)
/// } catch let error {
///     throw ErrorContext(
///         source: "PaymentProcessor",
///         operation: "processPayment",
///         details: "Invalid card number",
///         underlyingError: error
///     )
