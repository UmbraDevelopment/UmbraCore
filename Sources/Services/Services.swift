/// Services Module
///
/// Provides core service abstractions and implementations for UmbraCore.
/// This module defines the service layer architecture and implements
/// key platform services.
///
/// # Key Features
/// - Service lifecycle management
/// - Dependency injection
/// - Service discovery
/// - Health monitoring
///
/// # Module Organisation
///
/// ## Core Types
/// ```swift
/// Service
/// ServiceProvider
/// ServiceRegistry
/// ```
///
/// ## Lifecycle
/// ```swift
/// ServiceLifecycle
/// ServiceState
/// LifecycleManager
/// ```
///
/// ## Health
/// ```swift
/// HealthCheck
/// ServiceMetrics
/// HealthMonitor
/// ```
///
/// # Service Architecture
///
/// ## Service Registry
/// Central service management:
/// - Service registration
/// - Dependency resolution
/// - Service discovery
/// - State management
///
/// ## Lifecycle Management
/// Service lifecycle stages:
/// - Initialisation
/// - Configuration
/// - Start-up
/// - Shutdown
///
/// # Health Monitoring
///
/// ## Health Checks
/// Comprehensive health monitoring:
/// - Liveness probes
/// - Readiness checks
/// - Dependency health
///
/// ## Metrics Collection
/// Service metrics tracking:
/// - Performance metrics
/// - Resource usage
/// - Error rates
///
/// # Usage Example
/// ```swift
/// let registry = ServiceRegistry.shared
///
/// if let cryptoService: CryptoService = registry.service() {
///     try await cryptoService.start()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Dependency Management
///
/// ## Injection
/// - Constructor injection
/// - Property injection
/// - Method injection
///
/// ## Resolution
/// - Automatic resolution
/// - Circular dependency detection
/// - Optional dependencies
///
/// # Thread Safety
/// Service system is thread-safe:
/// - Thread-safe registry
/// - Atomic state changes
/// - Concurrent service access
public enum Services {
    /// Current version of the Services module
    public static let version = "1.0.0"

    /// Initialise Services with default configuration
    public static func initialize() {
        // Configure service system
    }
}
