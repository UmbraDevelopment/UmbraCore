/// Standard logging levels for classification of log messages
///
/// This enum provides a consistent set of severity levels for logging throughout the
/// UmbraCore framework. It establishes a clear hierarchy of message importance,
/// with critical messages being the most severe and trace messages the least severe.
///
/// The enum is marked as `@frozen` to ensure binary stability across module boundaries,
/// and conforms to `Comparable` to allow for filtering based on minimum severity levels.
///
/// Usage example:
/// ```swift
/// // Filter logs above warning level
/// func shouldLog(level: LogLevel) -> Bool {
///     return level >= .warning
/// }
/// ```
@frozen
public enum LogLevel: Int, Comparable, Sendable {
    /// Critical issues that require immediate attention
    /// These are severe errors that may lead to application termination or data loss
    case critical = 50

    /// Standard errors that should be addressed
    /// These indicate functionality is impaired but the application can continue running
    case error = 40

    /// Warning messages that indicate potential issues
    /// These highlight abnormal or unexpected system behaviour that might lead to errors
    case warning = 30

    /// Informational messages about system operation
    /// These provide runtime information about the normal functioning of the system
    case info = 20

    /// Debug information for development purposes
    /// These provide detailed information useful during development and troubleshooting
    case debug = 10

    /// Detailed trace information for in-depth debugging
    /// These provide extremely detailed information about code execution paths
    case trace = 0

    /// Comparison implementation for Comparable protocol
    ///
    /// Lower numeric values represent lower severity.
    /// This ordering makes `critical > error > warning > info > debug > trace`
    /// which allows for natural comparison operations when filtering by severity.
    public static func < (lhs: LogLevel, rhs: LogLevel) -> Bool {
        // Lower numeric values represent lower severity
        // This makes critical > error > warning > info > debug > trace
        lhs.rawValue < rhs.rawValue
    }
}
