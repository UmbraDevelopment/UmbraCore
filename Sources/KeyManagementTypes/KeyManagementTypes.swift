 # KeyManagementTypes Module
 
 This module provides type definitions for key management operations in UmbraCore.
 It serves as an umbrella module that exposes the key management types used throughout the UmbraCore framework.
 
 All types in this module are fully qualified, in line with the UmbraCore type policy
 which emphasises clarity over indirection.
