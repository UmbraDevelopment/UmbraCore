# UmbraCore Security Implementation

This module provides the core cryptographic infrastructure for the UmbraCore platform. It implements the interfaces defined in the SecurityProtocolsCore module and provides a comprehensive set of cryptographic operations, key management, and security services.

## ⚠️ Development Status

**WARNING: This module contains proof-of-concept implementations that are NOT suitable for production use without further review and enhancement.**

This module is designed for development and testing purposes and includes simplified implementations of certain cryptographic operations (particularly asymmetric encryption) that must be replaced with proper, cryptographically secure implementations before production use.

## Module Structure

### Core Components

- **SecurityProvider**: The main facade that provides a unified interface to the security subsystem
- **CryptoService**: Implements cryptographic operations like encryption, decryption, and hashing
- **KeyManager**: Handles key generation, storage, retrieval, and rotation

## Features

- **Symmetric Encryption**: AES-GCM with 256-bit keys
- **Key Management**: In-memory key storage with key rotation capabilities
- **Hashing**: SHA-256 implementation
- **Digital Signatures**: HMAC-based signing and verification
- **Thread Safety**: All operations are thread-safe using Swift actors and Sendable compliance
- **Foundation Independence**: No dependencies on Foundation for core cryptographic operations
- **Swift 6 Compatibility**: Designed to work with Swift 6

## Security Considerations

- **Memory Safety**: Keys and sensitive data are stored in SecureBytes containers to limit exposure
- **Key Management**: Keys should be properly rotated according to best practices
- **Cryptographic Algorithms**: Only modern, secure algorithms like AES-GCM are used
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting without leaking sensitive information

## Known Limitations

- **Asymmetric Cryptography**: The current implementation uses a simplified placeholder for asymmetric operations
- **In-Memory Key Storage**: No persistent secure storage for keys
- **Limited Cryptographic Primitives**: No support for key derivation functions or threshold cryptography
- **Foundation Independence**: Some utility functions (like Base64 encoding) use placeholders instead of real implementations

## Usage Examples

### Basic Encryption/Decryption

```swift
// Create the security provider
let securityProvider = SecurityProvider()

// Generate a key and store it
let crypto = securityProvider.cryptoService
let keyResult = await crypto.generateKey()
let key = keyResult.get()

// Encrypt data
let data = SecureBytes("Secret message".data(using: .utf8)!)
let encryptResult = await crypto.encrypt(data: data, using: key)
let encryptedData = encryptResult.get()

// Decrypt data
let decryptResult = await crypto.decrypt(data: encryptedData, using: key)
let decryptedData = decryptResult.get()
```

### Using the Key Manager

```swift
// Create a key manager
let keyManager = KeyManager()

// Generate and store a key
let keyResult = await keyManager.generateKey(keySize: 256)
let key = keyResult.get()
await keyManager.storeKey(key, withIdentifier: "my-encryption-key")

// Retrieve the key later
let retrievedKey = await keyManager.retrieveKey(withIdentifier: "my-encryption-key").get()

// Rotate the key
let newKey = await keyManager.rotateKey(withIdentifier: "my-encryption-key").get()
```

## Development Roadmap

1. Replace placeholder asymmetric encryption with production-ready implementation (RSA or ECC)
2. Implement secure persistent storage for keys
3. Add support for additional cryptographic primitives (KDF, threshold crypto)
4. Complete comprehensive security audit and penetration testing
5. Implement secure multi-party computation capabilities

## Testing and Validation

The module includes a comprehensive test suite in `SecurityImplementationTests.swift` that validates:

- Symmetric encryption and decryption
- Key generation and management
- Hashing functions
- Performance benchmarks for cryptographic operations

Run tests using:

```bash
bazel test //Sources/SecurityImplementation:tests
```

## Dependencies

- **CryptoSwiftFoundationIndependent**: Foundation-free cryptographic operations
- **SecureBytes**: Secure memory management for sensitive data
- **SecurityProtocolsCore**: Core interfaces and data types
