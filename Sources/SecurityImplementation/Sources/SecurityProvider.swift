 # UmbraCore Security Provider

 The SecurityProvider acts as a facade for the UmbraCore security subsystem, providing
 a unified interface to cryptographic operations and key management. It implements the
 SecurityProviderProtocol and coordinates between the various security services.

 ## Design Pattern

 This class follows the Facade design pattern, simplifying access to the security
 subsystem by providing a single entry point that coordinates between different
 components:

 * CryptoService: Handles encryption, decryption, hashing, and other cryptographic operations
 * KeyManager: Handles key generation, storage, retrieval, and lifecycle management

 ## Security Considerations

 * **Facade Security**: The provider enforces proper parameter validation and ensures
   that operations are called with appropriate parameters, reducing the chance of
   misusing the underlying services.

 * **Key Management**: The provider automatically handles key lookup by identifier when
   provided in the configuration, simplifying key management for callers.

 * **Error Handling**: The provider normalises error reporting across different security
   components, making it easier to handle errors consistently.

 * **Audit Trail**: In a production implementation, this class would be an appropriate
   place to implement security logging and audit trail features.

 ## Usage Guidelines

 * Use the `performSecureOperation` method for standard cryptographic operations
 * Use the `createSecureConfig` method to build properly formatted configuration objects
 * Access the `cryptoService` and `keyManager` properties directly for more specific operations
 * Always validate the success flag in the returned SecurityResultDTO

 ## Example Usage

 ```swift
 // Create the security provider
 let securityProvider = SecurityProvider()

 // Create a configuration for encryption
 let config = securityProvider.createSecureConfig(options: [
     "algorithm": "AES-GCM",
     "keySize": 256,
     "keyIdentifier": "data-encryption-key"
 ])

 // Perform an encryption operation
 let result = await securityProvider.performSecureOperation(
     operation: .symmetricEncryption,
     config: config
 )

 // Check the result
 if result.status == .success {
     // Use the encrypted data
     let encryptedData = result.data
 }
 ```

 ## Limitations

 * **Foundation Independence**: This implementation avoids Foundation dependencies,
   which means some features (like Base64 encoding/decoding) are placeholders.

 * **Not All Operations Implemented**: Some operations like asymmetric encryption,
   signature generation/verification, and MAC generation are not fully implemented.

 * **Development Stage**: This implementation is designed for development and testing.
   For production use, consider enhancing with:
     - Comprehensive logging and auditing
     - Input sanitization
     - Rate limiting for sensitive operations
     - More robust error handling

    /**
     Create a secure configuration with appropriate defaults for the security subsystem.

     - Parameter options: Optional dictionary of configuration options
     - Returns: A properly configured SecurityConfigDTO

     ## Available Options

     * `algorithm`: String - The encryption algorithm to use (default: "AES-GCM")
     * `keySize`: Int - The key size in bits (default: 256)
     * `iv`: String - Hex-encoded initialisation vector
     * `keyIdentifier`: String - Identifier for a key in the key manager
     * `inputData`: String - Base64-encoded input data

     ## Default Configuration

     If no options are provided, the method will return a configuration with:
     - Algorithm: AES-GCM
     - Key Size: 256 bits
     - No IV (a random one will be generated by the crypto service)
     - No key identifier (key must be provided separately)
     - No input data

     ## Example

     ```swift
     let config = securityProvider.createSecureConfig(options: [
         "algorithm": "AES-GCM",
         "keySize": 256,
         "keyIdentifier": "my-encryption-key"
     ])
     ```
