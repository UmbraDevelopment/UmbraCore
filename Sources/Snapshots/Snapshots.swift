/// Snapshots Module
///
/// Provides snapshot management and operations for UmbraCore.
/// This module handles all aspects of backup snapshots, from
/// creation to restoration.
///
/// # Key Features
/// - Snapshot management
/// - Differential backups
/// - Point-in-time recovery
/// - Snapshot policies
///
/// # Module Organisation
///
/// ## Core Types
/// ```swift
/// Snapshot
/// SnapshotManager
/// SnapshotPolicy
/// ```
///
/// ## Operations
/// ```swift
/// SnapshotCreator
/// SnapshotRestorer
/// SnapshotPruner
/// ```
///
/// ## Policies
/// ```swift
/// RetentionPolicy
/// SchedulingPolicy
/// TaggingPolicy
/// ```
///
/// # Snapshot Management
///
/// ## Creation
/// Efficient snapshot creation:
/// - Incremental snapshots
/// - Deduplication
/// - Compression
///
/// ## Restoration
/// Flexible restore options:
/// - Full restore
/// - Partial restore
/// - Mount operations
///
/// # Policy Management
///
/// ## Retention
/// Retention policy options:
/// - Time-based retention
/// - Count-based retention
/// - Tag-based retention
///
/// ## Scheduling
/// Scheduling capabilities:
/// - Periodic snapshots
/// - Event-driven snapshots
/// - Manual snapshots
///
/// # Data Management
///
/// ## Storage
/// Efficient storage usage:
/// - Content-addressed storage
/// - Pack file management
/// - Index optimisation
///
/// ## Deduplication
/// Advanced deduplication:
/// - Block-level dedup
/// - Cross-snapshot dedup
/// - Chunk optimisation
///
/// # Usage Example
/// ```swift
/// let manager = SnapshotManager.shared
/// 
/// let snapshot = try await manager.create(
///     path: path,
///     policy: policy
/// )
/// ```
///
/// # Performance
///
/// ## Optimisation
/// Performance features:
/// - Parallel operations
/// - Cache management
/// - I/O optimisation
///
/// ## Resource Management
/// Resource control:
/// - Memory limits
/// - I/O throttling
/// - CPU usage
///
/// # Thread Safety
/// Snapshot operations are thread-safe:
/// - Concurrent snapshots
/// - Safe restoration
/// - Atomic operations
public enum Snapshots {
