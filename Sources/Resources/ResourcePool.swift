/// lifecycle management including acquisition, release, and cleanup.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// let pool = ResourcePool<DatabaseConnection>(maxSize: 5)
///
/// // Add resources to the pool
/// try await pool.add(DatabaseConnection())
///
/// // Acquire and use a resource
/// let connection = try await pool.acquire()
/// defer { Task { await pool.release(connection) } }
///
/// // Use connection...
/// ```
