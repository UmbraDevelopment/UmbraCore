## Overview

UmbraCore's cryptographic services provide a modular, explicitly-selected implementation architecture that enforces clear separation between different cryptographic implementations while requiring developers to make conscious decisions about which implementation to use. This architecture follows the Alpha Dot Five principles with actor-based concurrency, strict privacy controls, and comprehensive logging.

## Modular Architecture

### Design Goals

1. **Explicit Implementation Selection**
   - Developers must explicitly choose which cryptographic implementation to use
   - Clear documentation of the trade-offs between different implementations
   - No implicit or automatic selection of implementations in production code

2. **Modular Architecture**
   - Each implementation exists in its own module with clear boundaries
   - Implementations do not share code beyond the common interfaces
   - Only the selected implementation gets built and deployed

3. **Enhanced Build Performance**
   - Reduced compile time by only building necessary implementations
   - Smaller binary size by eliminating unused cryptographic code
   - Simplified dependency graphs without circular references

4. **Clear Implementation Boundaries**
   - Standard Implementation: AES-based, general-purpose implementation
   - Cross-platform Implementation: RingFFI with Argon2id for platform-agnostic environments
   - Apple Platform Implementation: CryptoKit optimised for Apple ecosystems

### Module Structure

```
//packages/UmbraImplementations/Sources/CryptoServicesCore        (Common utilities, factory)
//packages/UmbraImplementations/Sources/CryptoServicesStandard    (Default AES implementation)
//packages/UmbraImplementations/Sources/CryptoServicesXfn         (Cross-platform with RingFFI)
//packages/UmbraImplementations/Sources/CryptoServicesApple       (Apple CryptoKit implementation)
```

## Implementation Selection

UmbraCore provides three distinct cryptographic implementations, each optimised for different use cases and environments. This guide helps developers make an informed decision about which implementation to use based on their specific requirements.

### Explicit Implementation Selection

The Alpha Dot Five architecture requires developers to explicitly select which cryptographic implementation they wish to use, rather than relying on automatic selection. This ensures conscious decision-making about important security characteristics.

```swift
// Example of explicit implementation selection
let cryptoService = await CryptoServiceSelection.create(
    implementationType: .applePlatform,  // Explicit selection
    logger: myLogger
)
```

### Available Implementations

#### Standard Implementation (`.standard`)

The standard implementation provides a balanced approach to security and compatibility, using AES-256-CBC encryption with standard key management.

**Key Characteristics:**
- AES-256-CBC encryption with proper initialisation vectors
- Standard SHA-256/SHA-512 hashing
- SecRandomCopyBytes for secure random generation
- Standard privacy controls in logging

**When to Use:**
- General-purpose cryptographic operations
- When working with Restic in non-specialised environments
- When performance and compatibility are primary concerns

**Build Configuration:**
```bash
bazelisk build //your/target --//packages/UmbraImplementations:crypto_implementation=standard
```

#### Cross-Platform Implementation (`.crossPlatform`)

The cross-platform implementation uses Ring cryptography library with Argon2id for maximum compatibility across different operating systems.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Platform-agnostic implementation
- Argon2id for password-based key derivation
- Constant-time implementations to prevent timing attacks
- Stricter privacy controls for sensitive environments

**When to Use:**
- When developing cross-platform applications (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- When requiring consistent behaviour across different environments
- For applications with heightened security requirements
- When using advanced key derivation like Argon2id

**Build Configuration:**
```bash
bazelisk build //your/target --//packages/UmbraImplementations:crypto_implementation=xfn
```

#### Apple Platform Implementation (`.applePlatform`)

The Apple platform implementation leverages Apple's CryptoKit for hardware-accelerated encryption on Apple devices.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Optimised specifically for Apple platforms
- Hardware acceleration where available
- AES-GCM for authenticated encryption
- Secure enclave integration on supported devices
- Full macOS/iOS sandboxing compliance

**When to Use:**
- When developing exclusively for Apple platforms
- When requiring hardware acceleration for cryptographic operations
- When operating within Apple's security and sandboxing guidelines
- For applications that need to leverage the Secure Enclave

**Build Configuration:**
```bash
bazelisk build //your/target --//packages/UmbraImplementations:crypto_implementation=apple
```

## Factory Pattern

As part of the Alpha Dot Five architecture implementation, we have consolidated multiple cryptographic service factory implementations into a single canonical implementation.

### Usage Examples

```swift
// Create a service with explicit type selection
let cryptoService = await CryptoServiceRegistry.createService(
    type: .applePlatform,
    logger: myLogger
)
```

### Key Benefits

1. **Eliminated Duplication**: Removed duplicate implementations between factories
2. **Improved Consistency**: Ensured consistent error handling and parameter patterns
3. **Enhanced Type Safety**: Updated parameter types to match the interfaces
4. **Better Dependency Management**: Eliminated circular dependencies between modules
5. **Streamlined API**: Provided a cleaner, more intuitive API for creating services

## Security Considerations

### Algorithm Selection

Each implementation uses different default algorithms:
- Standard: AES-256-CBC for encryption, SHA-256 for hashing
- Cross-Platform: ChaCha20-Poly1305 for encryption, BLAKE3 for hashing, Argon2id for key derivation
- Apple Platform: AES-GCM with hardware acceleration where available

### Entropy Sources

Implementations use different entropy sources:
- Standard: SecRandomCopyBytes (Apple Security framework)
- Cross-Platform: Ring's secure random implementation
- Apple Platform: CryptoKit.generateRandomBytes()

### Performance Characteristics

- Standard: Good general-purpose performance
- Cross-Platform: Consistent but potentially slower on some platforms
- Apple Platform: Optimised with potential hardware acceleration

## Migration Guide

### From Previous Implementation

If you are migrating from the previous non-modular implementation:

1. Replace direct imports:
   ```swift
   // Before
   import CryptoServices
   
   // After - choose one based on requirements
   import CryptoServicesCore    // For type definitions
   import CryptoServicesStandard // For standard implementation
   import CryptoServicesXfn     // For cross-platform implementation
   import CryptoServicesApple   // For Apple platform implementation
   ```

2. Update factory usage:
   ```swift
   // Before
   let cryptoService = await CryptoServiceFactory.createDefault()
   
   // After - with explicit type selection
   let cryptoService = await CryptoServiceSelection.create(
       implementationType: .standard,
       logger: myLogger
   )
   ```

3. Update build files:
   ```python
   # Add dependencies based on which implementation you need
   deps = [
       "//packages/UmbraImplementations/Sources/CryptoServicesCore",
       "//packages/UmbraImplementations/Sources/CryptoServicesStandard",
   ]
   ```

### Testing with Different Implementations

For complete test coverage, consider testing with all implementations:

```swift
// Test with standard implementation
func testWithStandardImpl() async {
    let cryptoService = await CryptoServiceSelection.create(
        implementationType: .standard,
        secureStorage: mockSecureStorage,
        logger: mockLogger
    )
    // Run tests...
}

// Test with cross-platform implementation
func testWithCrossPlatformImpl() async {
    let cryptoService = await CryptoServiceSelection.create(
        implementationType: .crossPlatform,
        secureStorage: mockSecureStorage,
        logger: mockLogger
    )
    // Run tests...
}

// Test with Apple platform implementation
func testWithApplePlatformImpl() async {
    let cryptoService = await CryptoServiceSelection.create(
        implementationType: .applePlatform,
        secureStorage: mockSecureStorage,
        logger: mockLogger
    )
    // Run tests...
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Make Explicit Decisions:** Always explicitly choose which implementation to use based on your requirements.

2. **Document Your Choice:** Include comments explaining why a particular implementation was selected.

3. **Test Thoroughly:** Each implementation may have slightly different behaviour, especially around edge cases.

4. **Consider the Environment:** Match your implementation choice to your deployment environment.

5. **Review Security Implications:** Each implementation has different security characteristics that should be understood.

## Next Steps

With the core implementation complete and the codebase consolidated, the following next steps are recommended:

1. **Testing & Validation**
   - Develop comprehensive test suites for each implementation

   - Enhance CryptoKit integration with Secure Enclave for Apple platforms
   - Update existing code that uses the previous non-modular implementation

3. **Documentation & Migration**
   - Create migration guides for existing code
   - Develop example applications demonstrating each implementation
   - Update API documentation with implementation-specific details

4. **Security Audit**
   - Conduct a security review of each implementation
   - Verify cryptographic properties across implementations
   - Document security characteristics and limitations

5. **Performance Optimisation**
   - Profile each implementation for performance bottlenecks
   - Optimise key operations for each target platform
   - Document performance characteristics

6. **Continuous Integration**
   - Set up CI pipelines for testing across implementations
   - Ensure build configurations correctly select implementations
   - Create validation tests for each platform

## Conclusion

The modular implementation of UmbraCore's cryptographic services provides developers with clear, explicit choices for their cryptographic needs. The architecture achieves the design goals of modularity, explicit selection, and clear implementation boundaries, while aligning with the Alpha Dot Five architecture principles.

Additionally, we've successfully consolidated and cleaned up redundant code, removing duplicated factory patterns and superseded implementations. The codebase is now cleaner, more maintainable, and better aligned with the modular architecture.

The next phases of work will focus on integration, testing, documentation, and performance optimisation to ensure the implementation is robust, secure, and easy to use across all target platforms.
