/**
 # Core Service Implementation

 This actor is the central implementation of the CoreServiceProtocol,
 providing access to all core services throughout the application.

 ## Architecture

 - Follows the singleton pattern to ensure a single point of service access
 - Uses dependency injection via a service container
 - Implements the faÃ§ade pattern to simplify access to subsystems
 - Uses adapters to isolate core components from implementation details
 - Ensures thread safety through the actor concurrency model

 ## Lifecycle Management

 The core service handles initialisation and shutdown of all dependent services,
 ensuring proper startup and cleanup procedures are followed.
