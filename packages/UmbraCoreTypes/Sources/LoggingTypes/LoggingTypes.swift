/// LoggingTypes Module
///
/// Provides core type definitions for the logging system, following the Alpha Dot Five
/// architecture principle of separation between types, interfaces, and implementations.
///
/// This module contains:
/// - Log level definitions
/// - Log entry structures
/// - Log metadata models
/// - Foundation-independent time representation
///
/// Following Alpha Dot Five principles, this module:
/// - Contains only type definitions
/// - Has minimal dependencies
/// - Avoids implementation details
/// - Is Foundation-independent where possible

// No need for @_exported imports here as these types are defined within this module
// and will be available when the module is imported
