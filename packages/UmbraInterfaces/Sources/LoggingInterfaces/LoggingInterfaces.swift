/// LoggingInterfaces Module
///
/// Provides protocol definitions for the logging system, following the Alpha Dot Five
/// architecture principle of separation between types, interfaces, and implementations.
///
/// This module contains:
/// - Logging protocol definitions
/// - Error types specific to logging interfaces
///
/// Following Alpha Dot Five principles, this module:
/// - Contains only interface definitions
/// - Depends only on core types
/// - Avoids implementation details
/// - Defines behaviours through protocols

// No need for @_exported import as the protocol is defined in this module
// and will be available when the module is imported
