# Restic Module Migration

## Migration Status

**Status**: Completed  
**Migration Date**: 2025-03-28  
**Alpha Dot Five Version**: 0.5.0  

## Overview

This document outlines the migration of the Restic-related modules from the legacy architecture to the new Alpha Dot Five architecture. The migration implements the actor-based concurrency model, proper interface separation, and British spelling documentation standards.

## Migrated Modules

| Legacy Module | Alpha Dot Five Module |
|---------------|------------------------|
| ResticTypes | ResticInterfaces |
| ResticCLIHelper | ResticServices |
| ResticCLIHelperModels | Integrated into ResticServices |

## Key Improvements

1. **Actor-based Implementation**:
   - Replaced direct class implementation with proper Swift actor
   - Ensured thread safety for all operations
   - Added task-based concurrency for long-running operations

2. **Interface Separation**:
   - Created dedicated ResticInterfaces module with protocol definitions
   - Separated command protocols for different operation types
   - Added factory protocols for better dependency injection

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Enhanced ResticError with more comprehensive error cases
   - Added recovery suggestions for all error types
   - Improved error context for better debugging

4. **Documentation Standards**:
   - Updated all documentation to use British English spelling
   - Enhanced documentation with examples and usage notes
   - Added proper README files with architecture overview

5. **Naming Improvements**:
   - Renamed types to be more descriptive and clear
   - Consistently applied naming conventions across all components
   - Improved type names to better reflect their purpose

## Migration Strategy

The migration followed the established Alpha Dot Five pattern:

1. Created interface definitions in ResticInterfaces module
2. Implemented actor-based service in ResticServices module
3. Added factory implementation for service creation
4. Ensured comprehensive test coverage (to be completed)

## Dependencies

- UmbraErrors
- LoggingInterfaces

## Next Steps

1. Create comprehensive unit tests for the new modules
2. Update any code that referenced the legacy modules to use the new interfaces
3. Add the migrated modules to the migration_status.json file
4. Archive the original modules in the MigratedArchive structure once all dependents have been updated

## Migration Verification

To verify this migration is functioning correctly, you should:

1. Run the unit tests once they are created
2. Verify that all Restic operations work as expected
3. Confirm concurrency safety with parallel operations
4. Check error handling for edge cases
