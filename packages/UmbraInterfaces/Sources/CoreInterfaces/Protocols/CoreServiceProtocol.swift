/**
 # Core Service Protocol
 
 This protocol defines the main entry point for accessing core services throughout the application.
 
 ## Purpose
 
 - Serves as the central access point for all core system services
 - Manages initialisation and lifecycle of critical system components
 - Provides service location functionality via a dependency container
 
 ## Architecture Notes
 
 The CoreServiceProtocol follows the faÃ§ade pattern, simplifying access to 
 the various subsystems while managing their lifecycle. It uses adapter protocols
 to isolate components from implementation details of other system parts.
