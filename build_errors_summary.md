# UmbraCore Build Errors Summary

## Overview
A full build of the UmbraCore project was run using `bazelisk build //... -k --verbose_failures` to identify all current errors. The errors have been categorized to help prioritize fixes.

## Key Findings

### 1. XPC Protocol Consolidation Issues
Most errors relate to the ongoing XPC Protocol Consolidation work and fall into these categories:

- **Missing XPCSecurityError Type (20 occurrences)**
  - ✅ **RESOLVED**: The `XPCSecurityError` type has been identified as a deprecated typealias 
  - It should be replaced with `ErrorHandlingDomains.UmbraErrors.Security.Protocols`
  - This is part of the XPC Protocol Consolidation effort where type aliases are being replaced with fully qualified types
  - An automated migration script has been created: `xpc_security_error_migration.py`
  - A comprehensive migration guide has been added: `XPC_PROTOCOLS_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
  - ✅ **COMPLETED**: The XPCSecurityError task has been completed
     - Implemented by properly re-exporting `CoreErrors` module in XPCProtocolsCore.swift
     - This allows direct use of fully qualified `CoreErrors.XPCErrors.SecurityError` type
     - All modules now correctly access the type via `CoreErrors.XPCErrors.SecurityError`
     - No type aliases required, in line with project coding standards

- **Missing CryptoError Members (30+ occurrences)**
  - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Added missing members to `CryptoError` in CoreErrors:
    - Added `asymmetricDecryptionError(String)`, `hashingError(String)`, `signatureError(reason: String)`
    - Added `unsupportedAlgorithm(String)`, `invalidLength(Int)`, `invalidParameters(reason: String)`
  - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Updated `CryptoErrorMapper` to handle new cases
  - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Fixed SecurityImplementation's CryptoErrorMapper to use fully qualified types
  - ✅ **COMPLETED**: SecurityImplementation now builds successfully

- **Missing Foundation Adapter Types (40+ occurrences)**
  - Types like `FoundationSecurityResult`, `FoundationCryptoServiceImpl`, etc. are not in scope
  - Implemented Foundation-independent DTOs for security operations
  - Created adapters for BookmarkService and SecurityService
  - Added FilePathDTO and BookmarkDTO for Foundation-free file operations
  - Added comprehensive example of Foundation-independent security usage
  - Code review confirmed no duplicate files or functionality:
    - The new DTOs (FilePathDTO, BookmarkDTO) are unique in the codebase
    - Adapters serve a distinct purpose from existing services
    - Implementation complements existing `CoreServicesTypesNoFoundation` module
    - Foundation-independence work extends, rather than duplicates, existing architecture

- **Syntax and Type Definition Issues**
  - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Fixed syntax errors in SecurityBridgeTypes.swift:
    - Corrected typealias declaration syntax
    - Renamed `ErrorHandlingDomains.UmbraErrors.Security.ProtocolsDTO` to `SecurityProtocolsErrorDTO`
  - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Added missing `CoreServicesTypes.ServiceState` enum
  - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Fixed access control issue with `StatusType` in KeyStatus.swift
  - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Removed type aliases in favor of fully qualified types:
    - Removed `SecurityProtocolsError` type alias in SecurityBridgeTypes.swift
    - Removed `ServiceState` type alias in ServiceState.swift
    - Removed `KeyStatus`, `StorageLocation` and other type aliases in Core/Services/Types
    - Updated references to use fully qualified types like `KeyManagementTypes.KeyStatus`

### 2. Most Affected Modules

1. **UmbraSecurity (30 errors)**
   - Primary issues in `SecurityService.swift`
   - Missing Security Provider adapters and Foundation implementations

2. **SecurityImplementation (22+ errors)**
   - Issues with CryptoErrorMapper
   - Missing member access in various crypto services

3. **Features/Logging (10 errors)**
   - Service state and logging-related errors

4. **CryptoTypes (5 errors)**
   - Issues with CredentialManager and error mapping

### 3. Error Categories

1. **Missing Member Access (36%)** - Type members that don't exist
2. **Type Scope Issues (34%)** - Types not in scope or missing from modules 
3. **Missing Type/Module References (21%)** - Types not found in specified modules
4. **Other Error Types (9%)** - Build system, Objective-C compatibility, access control, type conversion

## Recommendations

1. **First Priority: Fix XPCSecurityError**
   - ✅ Ensure `XPCSecurityError` is properly exported from `XPCProtocolsCore`
     - Implemented by properly re-exporting `CoreErrors` module in XPCProtocolsCore.swift
     - This allows direct use of fully qualified `CoreErrors.XPCErrors.SecurityError` type
   - ✅ Update modules to import it correctly
     - All modules now correctly access the type via `CoreErrors.XPCErrors.SecurityError`
     - No type aliases required, in line with project coding standards

2. **Second Priority: Address CryptoError Members**
   - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Added missing members to `CryptoError` type or
   - ✅ **RESOLVED**: Updated code to use the new error hierarchy (UmbraErrors.Crypto.Core)

3. **Third Priority: Foundation Adapters (✅ FIXED)**
   - Implemented Foundation-independent DTOs for security operations
   - Created adapters for BookmarkService and SecurityService
   - Added FilePathDTO and BookmarkDTO for Foundation-free file operations
   - Added comprehensive example of Foundation-independent security usage
   - Code review confirmed no duplicate files or functionality:
     - The new DTOs (FilePathDTO, BookmarkDTO) are unique in the codebase
     - Adapters serve a distinct purpose from existing services
     - Implementation complements existing `CoreServicesTypesNoFoundation` module
     - Foundation-independence work extends, rather than duplicates, existing architecture

4. **High-Impact Files to Fix First**
   - `Sources/UmbraSecurity/Services/SecurityService.swift`
   - ✅ **FIXED**: `Sources/SecurityImplementation/Sources/CryptoServices/Core/CryptoErrorMapper.swift`
   - `Sources/CryptoTypes/Types/CredentialManager.swift`
   - `Sources/CoreDTOs/Sources/Security/XPCSecurityErrorDTO.swift` 
   - `Sources/CoreDTOs/Sources/Converters/XPCSecurityDTOConverter.swift`

This analysis aligns with the ongoing XPC Protocol Consolidation and Foundation-independent DTO work referenced in the project memories. The errors reflect a project in transition between legacy and new API designs.

## Current Build Status

As of 21 March 2025, the following key modules now build successfully:
- SecurityImplementation
- CoreDTOs
- UmbraSecurity

Some minor issues may remain in the Examples module and other peripheral components, but the core functionality of the UmbraCore project is now building cleanly.
