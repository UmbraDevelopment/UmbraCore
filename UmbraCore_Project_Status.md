# UmbraCore XPC Protocol Migration Status Report

*Report Date: 6 March 2025*

## Executive Summary

The UmbraCore XPC Protocol Migration is structurally complete, particularly for Crypto-related XPC protocols (100% complete). However, the full build process currently succeeds for only 68 of 155 top-level targets (44% success rate). The primary blockers are related to module dependencies, particularly isolation modules required for namespace resolution, and core build infrastructure issues.

## Migration Achievement Overview

- **Overall Protocol Migration**: Complete for targeted modules
- **Protocol Standardisation**: Implemented three-tier protocol hierarchy (Basic, Standard, Complete)
- **Error Handling**: Standardised on `Result<Success, XPCSecurityError>` pattern
- **Module Structure**: Created migration adapters for legacy code compatibility

## Build Status Analysis

- **Build Success Rate**: 68 of 155 top-level targets (44%)
- **Test Status**: 62 passing tests, 2 failing tests out of 64 test cases
- **Failed Components**: 87 top-level targets failed to build

## Detailed Issue Categories

### 1. Core Build Infrastructure Issues

```
ERROR: /Users/mpy/CascadeProjects/UmbraCore/tools/BUILD.bazel:6:21: in umbracore_gen_module rule //tools:gen_secure_string: 
Error in format: Missing argument 'path'
```

Several Bazel build infrastructure components are failing with toolchain and build rule errors:
- `gen_secure_string`, `gen_time_types`, and `gen_url_path` tools
- `macos_arm64_toolchain_config` and related toolchain configurations
- Incorrect parameters being passed to toolchain configuration functions

### 2. Module Dependency Issues

```
error: no such module 'SecurityProtocolsCoreIsolation'
```

The isolation pattern used in `CoreTypes/SecurityErrorBase.swift` requires two modules that appear to be missing or not properly configured:
- `SecurityProtocolsCoreIsolation`
- `XPCProtocolsCoreIsolation`

This appears to be central to the namespace resolution strategy being implemented for providing access to security-related types without namespace conflicts.

### 3. Error Types and API Mismatches

```
error: enum case 'notFound' has no associated values
```

Multiple error handling issues in the Repository module:
- Repository error cases defined without associated values but used with parameters
- Missing error case (`validationFailed`) 
- Inconsistent error patterns across multiple files
- Migration of error types to structured format incomplete

### 4. Test Formatting Inconsistencies

```
XCTAssertEqual failed: ("Optional("XPC message failed: Failed to send")") 
is not equal to ("Optional("Failed to send XPC message: Failed to send")")
```

Error message format in tests does not match implementation, likely due to changes during protocol migration. The error message format has been updated in the implementation but tests are still expecting the old format.

## Module Status Matrix

| Module Category | Status | Issue Highlights |
|-----------------|--------|------------------|
| **XPC Protocol Core** | ✅ Complete | Successfully migrated |
| **UmbraCryptoService** | ✅ Complete | Successfully migrated |
| **CoreTypes** | ❌ Failing | Missing module dependencies |
| **CryptoSwiftFoundationIndependent** | ❌ Failing | Build errors |
| **SecurityBridge** | ❌ Failing | Multiple build failures |
| **SecurityInterfaces** | ❌ Failing | Failed to build tests |
| **Repository Module** | ❌ Failing | Error type mismatches |
| **Core Build Infrastructure** | ❌ Failing | Missing arguments, toolchain configuration errors |
| **Isolation Modules** | ❌ Missing | Required for namespace resolution |

## Dependency Analysis

The build failures suggest a cascading dependency chain:

1. Core build infrastructure needs fixes (toolchain configs)
2. Isolation modules need to be created/properly configured
3. CoreTypes depends on isolation modules
4. Multiple modules depend on CoreTypes

## Environmental Information

- **Bazel Version**: 8.1.1 with bzlmod
- **Swift Target**: arm64-apple-macos15.4
- **Xcode Version**: 16.2.0.16C5032a

## Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate Priorities:

1. **Fix Infrastructure Issues**:
   - Address the `'path'` argument missing in build rule definitions
   - Update toolchain configuration to align with Bazel expected parameters

2. **Implement Isolation Module Pattern**:
   - Create or properly configure `SecurityProtocolsCoreIsolation` and `XPCProtocolsCoreIsolation` modules
   - Update CoreTypes/BUILD.bazel to include these dependencies

3. **Standardise Error Handling**:
   - Fix Repository error types to match usage patterns
   - Decide on error format standardisation for tests vs implementation
   - Update tests to match new error message format or adjust implementation

### Secondary Priorities:

1. **Continue Module Migration**:
   - Complete migration of remaining modules once core dependencies are fixed
   - Update documentation to reflect latest changes

2. **Comprehensive Test Strategy**:
   - Develop test adapters for transitional period if needed
   - Update test expectations to match new format

## Conclusion

The XPC Protocol Migration is structurally complete for the targeted modules, but surrounding infrastructure and dependency issues must be addressed to complete the full project build. The primary focus should be on the isolation module pattern implementation, as this appears to be foundational to the architecture of the project's module system.

The migration has successfully modernised the protocol structure but revealed underlying architectural dependencies that need resolution. By addressing these issues systematically, beginning with core infrastructure and dependency chain issues, the project can be brought to a fully buildable state.
